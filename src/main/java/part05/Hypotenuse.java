//
// SECTION A — FOLLOW ALONG: type the code from the video (or the guide) in this class.
//    His class is called Main. Yours is called Hypotenuse.
//    Leave the "package part05;" line and the "public class Hypotenuse" line alone.
//    The import line goes BETWEEN them (the guide shows where).
//
// SECTION B — COMMENTS: when you finish, put a // comment ABOVE every line of code,
//    saying in YOUR OWN WORDS what that line does.
